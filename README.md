# AngelSoftWorks FreeRTOS ECS

This project provides a minimal FreeRTOS-based embedded system template. It serves as a starting point for embedded software development using FreeRTOS with basic task management, hardware abstraction, and system configuration.

## Features

- ✅ Minimal functional FreeRTOS "blinky" demo.
- ✅ Clean project structure to easily scale up.
- ✅ Prepared for further integration of drivers, middleware, and application layers.
- ✅ Designed for educational purposes, internal development, or real product prototypes.
