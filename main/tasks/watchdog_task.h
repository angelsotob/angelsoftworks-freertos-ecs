/**
 * @file watchdog_task.h
 * @brief Interface for the watchdog monitoring system in FreeRTOS.
 *
 * Declares the `watchdog_task` and the shared `task_alive_flags_t`
 * structure used to detect stalled tasks and trigger system resets.
 *
 * Each monitored task should periodically set its corresponding
 * `*_alive` flag to true. The watchdog task clears the flags and
 * checks them again after a defined interval (5 seconds).
 *
 * If any flag remains false, the system is assumed to be unresponsive
 * and is restarted.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  - Include this header in each task.
 *  - Set `g_task_alive_flags.<task>_alive = true` inside the loop.
 *  - Create the `watchdog_task` at startup.
